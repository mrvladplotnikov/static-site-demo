Vlad is a master of his craft. His work was performed at a very high level and at the same time in a very acceptable term. Vlad has managed to catch the atmosphere of our game very clearly and to create a suitable sound design, which has not only fit perfectly into the gameplay but also emphasized the style of Fate Hunters.
