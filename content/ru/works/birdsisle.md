BirdsIsle is a match-3 game with beautiful graphics, where you need to go through different levels to earn coins and build the ornitary of your dreams. You can buy new birds, plants, and decorations. The better your island will be, the happier the birds you settle there will live!

## Sound concept

For this project, the graphics of the game dictated the sound concept. Tropical jungle, cartoonish-looking birds, and colorful fruits in a row — it was immediately apparent that we needed funny and casual background music.

We’ve chosen ukulele, marimba, various ethnic wind instruments, and percussion for the soundtrack. We’ve made the sound not too «lively» — to maintain the impression of cartoonishness. We tried to make the melody discreet but not too background-y — to maintain interest during the process.

We’ve made all the sound effects in the tonality of the background music so that everything sounds harmonious in the finale. Also, with the developer, we initially divided the sounds into two categories: essential game notifications and sounds that often repeat in the gameplay. We made the latter neutral so they don’t annoy the player.

## Challenge

For the game BirdsIsle, we re-made the sound design for the match-3 mode. The thing is that initially, there was different music and sound design, and the players did not stay in the game for a long time.

We had to use sound to influence the audience’s engagement in the game and increase retention rates.

To do this, we analyzed the project’s target audience and their preferences and examined the previous design’s errors. Based on everything that we learned, we made our version.

A month after the project ended, the developer informed us that the players’ engagement indicators had grown. Challenge completed!
