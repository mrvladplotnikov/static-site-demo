Jane is a young novice designer who has to go all the way to a professional with a worldwide reputation. And you can help her in this challenging but exciting journey!

Go through the levels, earn points, and transform beautiful houses, hotels, and restaurants around the world together with Jane. Use your design vision and have fun.

You can download the game for {{<link_blank "Android" "">}}.

## Sound concept

We immediately understood: the soundtrack to the game Jane’s Story should be, well, about Jane herself! Therefore, we created the main theme, which runs the leitmotif throughout the soundtrack to the game.

In this melody, we have put sensations from the character, her story, her enthusiasm, and her love for work. This theme has become an excellent base with which we composed music for match-3 mode, meta-game, and various locations.

We created the soundtrack using acoustic guitar and drums, various string instruments, marimba, and flute.

We created sound effects for the game in the tonality of the music so that everything sounds harmonious. Sounds are made very neat, given that they often have to overlap.

## Challenge

In this project, it was essential for us to find a balance between the emotionality and background soundtrack. Once again. 🙂 Although we do love emotional music, we know that it can quickly bother a player.

The average game session in a game like Jane’s Story lasts long enough, so the music option with vivid emotion was turned down immediately. Instead, we made a relaxed background track with a few bright accents and alternating patterns to add mood and variety.
