WildCraft is a wildlife simulator game. An exciting journey awaits you as a wolf, lynx, fox, or other inhabitants of forests, jungles, and savannahs.

Explore the vast world, watch the seasons change, find friends, unite with them in families, raise cubs, and protect the family from enemies. Find rare species of animals and discover new opportunities for your pet.

## Sound concept

We’ve decided that we want the sound to convey an exact idea—an idea of making a player feel like wandering through wild woods.

To do this, we used a minimum of instruments, composed simple melodies, and diluted the tracks with “forest” ambient. As a result, we got the sound as if someone playing ethnic instruments in the forest.

By the way, we used ethnic instruments to emphasize the game’s connection with wildlife even more.

For a combat theme, we accelerated the pace of the soundtrack and added rhythm and powerful percussion, which helps the players get focused before the fight with the enemy, cheers them up, and supports them in the process.

## Challenge

As for any game with a long gaming session, we initially had to solve the problem of player perception of background music. It should not be too intrusive and quickly annoying, but it should not be ultimately “nothing” and monotonous.

To diversify the gaming experience, we wrote several compositions in a single style that can easily combine in random order. All of them maintain the same atmosphere, but each in their way. 

The main challenge of the project was waiting for us at the moment of sound design. To create sounds of some animals from the game, our sound designer had to visit the zoo several times and patiently wait for the necessary sounds performed by the actual animals.

## Story Mode

At the beginning of 2022, two new modes appeared in the game: [Ocean World](wildcraft-ocean-world) and Story Mode. While the first one feels like a brand-new game, the second is a logical extension of the classic WildCraft.

In Story Mode, players can immerse in interactive stories of the animal world. They can also decide the fate of the main characters.

We created seven new compositions to enhance the gaming experience. They embody emotions and feelings like love, adventure, fear, sadness, inspiration, etc. And even though these tracks are pretty short, they fulfill entirely the storylines.

The audience liked the new batch of tracks, so we released them as a separate album.

You can listen to the Story Mode soundtrack below:
