## Sound concept

The soundtrack for Necromancer perfectly complements the overall concept of a dark and frightening dungeon. The sound of the gothic organ and the contrasting glockenspiel (xylophone) create an oppressive and disturbing atmosphere.

The music as a whole is not too dynamic, but it can not be called ‚Äújust background‚Äù music. Its main task is to engage the players and prevent them from being distracted and bored.

The inspiration was the soundtrack for the Interstellar movie. Perhaps because of the organ, but this is not 100% sure. üôÇ

## Challenge

In this project, the most challenging moment for us was the stage of the search for a style of music. Initially, the developer wanted us to do just dark ambient for the background. But after several attempts, we realized that such music does not sufficiently engage the players. Therefore, we decided to experiment, and as a result, the sound became more complex.
