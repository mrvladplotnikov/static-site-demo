## About the game

Perfect Match is a multiplayer arcade game about artists in which you have to compete with other people in the accuracy of your color perception. 

Here you have the opportunity to play as your favorite artist in a pleasant, relaxed atmosphere. Also, everyone has an equal chance to win, regardless of the player’s current level! 

Each victory will allow you to develop your character, and experiment with new skins and backgrounds.

## Sound concept

We created the main and gameplay themes for this project, and we also developed its sound design.

The general mood of Perfect Match is determined mainly by the bright and cartoonish visuals of the game. But, at the same time, the developers’ team wanted the players to dive into a relaxed and inspiring atmosphere.

We created an audio concept considering all these aspects. We also added some French flair to the music to underline the romanticized artists’ life. Fun fact: Vlad started to learn French while he was working on the main theme. It came out really measured and for sure has that well-loved charm of France.

Regarding the gameplay theme, it appears more cheerful and dynamic, exactly to keep the player engaged and toned up. After all, the game is still about competing with other players. 🙂

We developed the sound design with the same concept as the soundtrack. We focused on organic sounds and «warm» instruments to make the game design more tactile and help the player feel the overall atmosphere.
