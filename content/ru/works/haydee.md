Haydee is a hardcore Metroidvania mixed with a third-person shooter and platformer mechanics.

In this game, you control Haydee, a half-human, half-robot character, searching for her way out of a strange artificial complex full of traps, pain, and despair. No checkpoints, regeneration, or «X» to win. All items are hidden, inventory is limited, and death awaits everywhere. What could be better? 🙂

Many consider the sexy protagonist to be the main feature of the game. However, the «cultural shock» will pass in 15 minutes, and you’ll see that the excellent hardcore gameplay is the main reason this game is so awesome.

## Sound concept

For Vlad, the first «serious» game dev project he worked on was Haydee. Already at that time, he clearly understood that the right music creates the right atmosphere.

He analyzed the general concept of the game and the gameplay and decided to emphasize the oppressive sound. The sound could make the hard core of the game stand out even more. The result is an atmospheric mix of electronics and ambient, somewhat reminiscent of the Tangerine Dream.

An interesting fact: the soundtrack is primarily written in Omnisphere. And in the game’s main theme, there is an electric guitar to add some melodies.

## Challenge

In the game, the main character wanders through a mysterious complex divided into different zones. They differ in color, atmosphere, dangers, and, of course, soundtrack.

The sound of each zone had to reflect its distinctive features and, at the same time, remain in the general style of the entire game soundtrack. Besides, it was important not to allow musical themes to overlap. It was the main challenge of the project.
