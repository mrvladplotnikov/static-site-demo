Bronze Hoof is an antique-style hardcore arcade game. It is genuinely hardcore in every sense. From the positioning of the developers («you will certainly suffer in our game») to the way we wrote the soundtrack (we’ve worked on it for two years). 

The main character is a centaur who tirelessly runs into the distance with «fire and sword», or instead, with fire and arrows, cuts down all petty evil and frightening bosses.

## Sound concept

Initially, we aimed to create an epic mixture of an orchestra and audacious electronics as the developer wanted.

Later, we’ve transformed this idea. In the final version, the leading «role» in the soundtrack plays an epic orchestra framed by various styles, among which the most recognizable ones are Egyptian and Ancient Eastern.

The instruments of the orchestra intentionally do not sound too «lively.» It is necessary so that the music complements the cartoonish gameplay in the right manner.

The main soundtrack task is to help the player feel his or her coolness even more while passing each level. The primary mission of the sound effects is to maintain the general atmosphere of the game.

## Challenge

It would be an ordinary project without a puzzle for the composer. The main difficulty was that each level was divided by portals, between which the melody must change significantly. However, there still should be only one track for the level.

Besides, portals were on random positions on a level, and this did not allow us to make a linear track with smooth transitions from one part to another.

As a result, we had to adjust the arrangement to each level’s design to avoid sharp breaks in the melody.

That is why music is best evaluated in the context of the game. You need to see (or rather hear) for yourself how it works together with the gameplay. To do this, you can {{%link_blank "download the game" ""%}} or watch a video with the passage of all levels below.
