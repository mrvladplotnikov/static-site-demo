{{<service_first_section title="The language of music has no boundaries, and that's what makes it so powerful.">}}
We are physically unable to ignore music, and its meanings are immediately absorbed into our subconscious, affecting our state and emotions and forming associations and memories.

Properly created music is much more than just a complement to the atmosphere of your product; it is an effective tool that fuels the audience's interest and increases engagement and sales.

That's why we believe that music for any commercial project should be created with all marketing aspects of the product in mind, not just based on creative intuition.

We compose soundtracks and create music for:

We can also compose music for motion graphics, but it mainly intersects with a well-thought-out sound design, so we advise you to [read more about it here](/en/works/audio-for-motion-design/).

{{%service_section title="What is the process like?"%}}

Over the past years, we have developed a clear and compelling cooperation scheme that makes the creative process fast, exciting, and, most importantly, predictable. It allows us to co-create with you a product that your audience will love and remember.

Below, we'll explain the pipeline, which is typical for composing game soundtracks. Although it is very similar to the scheme of creating audio brands, we recommend that you go to the [relevant page](/en/services/audio-branding/) if you are interested in branded music.

{{<details "1" "Getting to know each other" >}}
Кожен проєкт ми починаємо з віртуальної зустрічі, на якій дізнаємося основну інформацію про вашу гру та визначаємося з попереднім списком аудіоасетів, які нам потрібно буде створити.

Окрім цього ми обговорюємо, як буде побудований процес роботи, адже для нас важливо збігатися з клієнтом у загальному баченні співпраці.

Якщо ви не можете ділитися інформацією про проєкт без NDA, то на початку спілкування ми підписуємо необхідні документи.
{{</details >}}
{{<details "2" "Legal formalities" >}}
We clarify the project scope and the payments' quantity and order, sign a contract with you, and obtain an advance payment. Learn more about financial and legal matters in our [FAQ](/en/faq).

{{<details "3" "Pre-production" >}}
This stage is, without exaggeration, the most important in the entire project and, therefore, often the longest. Over the years of work, we learned that without proper preparation, nothing will work out (and there will be a lot of edits, lost time, and nerves).

Of course, the starting point is the brief, thanks to which we learn more details about your game, its main idea, audience, competitors, etc. Most importantly, we determine the emotions and associations that your future soundtrack should evoke.

Next, we conduct research to gather information about the audio codes and clichés of your genre, as well as the expectations and preferences of the target audience. Thanks to this, we primarily form an understanding of how the soundtrack will help you stand out from the crowd.

Having all the necessary information, we create a technical task and start forming the [audio concept](/en/faq#Audioconcept) for your game. We also compile [audio mood boards](/en/faq#Audiomoodboard) to show you the creative vector and establish a shared vision as early as possible.

After the listening party (the clients' favourite part!), we jointly specify the project's creative framework and finalize its audio concept.

{{<details "4" "Production" >}}
Well, we've finally reached the point where we start working on the audio! 

First, we create a few demos of the main musical theme (or an [audio DNA](/en/faq#AudioDNA), as we usually call it) — the basis of your game's future sound. These demos embody the ideas of the audio concept in different ways and help us find the perfect formula for combining various elements that will work for your audience.

Next, we send the demos to you for feedback (after sharing a practical methodology for providing it!) to determine how accurately they capture the idea and atmosphere of your game. However, it's the audience who always has the last word.

That's why, if possible, we conduct testing on your players together with you, and, based on the results, decide on the final version of the main theme.

And then everything is super easy and quick. Based on the approved audio DNA, we create all the necessary audio adaptations (gameplay themes, trailer music, [sound design](/en/services/sound-design), etc.). 
{{</details >}}
{{<details "5" "Project acceptance" >}}
After all the approvals, we send you the final files. You implement the tracks into your project and give us access to it so that we can make sure everything sounds right. It's also a good idea to conduct playtests at this stage to check how players perceive the tracks.

If something goes wrong, we make a list of fixes and ensure you can adjust everything correctly.

When everything is ready and sounds good, we sign an acceptance certificate, and you send us the final part of the payment.

{{<details "6" "Support" >}}
We like to follow our partners' progress and are always ready to continue cooperating and adapting new audio to your product. Within the initially developed concept framework, of course. :)
