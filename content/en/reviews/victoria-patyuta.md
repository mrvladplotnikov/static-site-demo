A professional in his field: a clear understanding of the tasks, a deep analysis of the project, always on time (often much earlier) finishing the outlined volume of work, the ability to listen and hear the customer, the presence of oneâ€™s own opinion and intuition, which greatly helped to fulfil tasks.
