We had less than a month before the release, and we were not sure that the guys would want to take on the project, given the tough deadline and the amount of work. But on the contrary, they were ready and the project was taken into work. Having picked up the music references, short background tracks were developed in the game, which is aimed at maximizing the sense of wildlife around.

Sounds for all animals in the game have been developed to further convey the atmosphere. The project was released on time and people positively appreciated our common contribution to the development of quality music and sounds. WildCraft is further updated with new features and animals by the Turbo Rocket Games team, and VP Production successfully gives them sound.
