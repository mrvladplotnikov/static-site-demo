For effective communication of MAUDAU, as an online product that cannot be touched in real life, it is imperative to engage the other senses of our guests. Thatâ€™s why we wanted MAUDAU to sound! Not just in any way, but consistently and correctly, broadcasting our values and character of the brand.

With the VP Production agency, we successfully transformed MAUDAU into an audio format and built a comprehensive brand sound system at various contact points with our guests. Respect to the VP team for not being afraid of tricky challenges!
