## Organizational details

{{< details "1" "How do I get started?" >}}
First of all, we need to get to know your project and you. To do this, you fill out a brief, and we conduct a [free consultation](mailto:{{% site_email %}}) for you. Then, if everything is good, it only remains to prepare the technical task and sign the contract.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "2" "What if my project is under the NDA?" >}}
You can [email us](mailto:{{% site_email %}}), we will sign all the needed documents, and after, we will be able to discuss everything freely.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "3" "Do you do test tasks?" >}}
We usually don’t carry out test tasks as they don’t really fit our work approach and pipelines. We start every project from the research and audio concept creation, and we can’t see how it can work well with the whole «test task» concept.

We understand that for many people, test tasks are a way to get to know a new team better and to understand how much cooperation is possible in general. For us, it is equally important to match with the client in the general vision and principles of work.

That is why we spend a lot of time on preliminary communication with the client, talk about all the nuances of the upcoming work, discuss the project and its needs, share initial ideas, and show relevant cases from our practice.

However, there’s an exception for the voice-over projects, for that we can provide a free voice talent audition.

{{< details "4" "Who prepares the technical task of the project?" >}}
Ideally, a client initiates the process of technical task creation by assembling an asset list with corresponding visuals/animations and basic requirements. For that, you can use.

Then we step in and develop a document based on the in-depth client brief, niche, competitors, and target audience analysis.

In such a way, both sides have crystal clear results expectations from the very beginning. It helps to choose the direction and to lay a solid foundation for the success of a collaboration.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "5" "How is the rest of the work process organized?" >}}
The process may vary depending on the chosen service, although the main six stages remain unchanged: acquaintance, legal formalities, pre-production, production, project acceptance, and further support.

You can read in detail the organization of each of our services on the following pages: [music composing]({{% relref "/services/music-composing" %}}), [sound design]({{% relref "/services/sound-design" %}}), [audio branding]({{% relref "/services/audio-branding" %}}) and [voice casting]({{% relref "/services/voice-casting" %}}).

## Financial questions

{{< details "1" "Financial questions" >}}
Yes, we work on a prepaid basis. Therefore, the advance payment amount may vary depending on the project scope, duration, and chosen services. It can be 50% of the total amount, multiple small payments, or a full prepayment in some cases.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "2" "In what cases, 100 % prepayment is required?" >}}
Full prepayment is required for any voice-over services and any consultation type.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "3" "How can I pay for your services?" >}}
We accept payments for the provided services only to the physical person entrepreneur (PPE) account.
{{< /details >}}

## Legal questions

{{< details "1" "Do you have a contract?" >}}
Yes, we sign a contract for providing services with each client. We have a cool and craft contract — all thanks to the team of lawyers with whom we work.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "2" "Will I get the rights to the result?" >}}
By default, we transfer to you all exclusive intellectual property rights to the sound effects, voice-overs, and audio brand elements we created, of course, on one condition — after you pay for our services.

By default, we transfer to you the intellectual property rights to the music compositions that we created, with the restriction on their free resale and re-release, outside the project we have agreed on and monetization from streaming services and marketplaces.

If necessary, we can transfer all exclusive intellectual property rights without restrictions, but we should discuss this separately. In this case, the total cost of the project will be higher.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "3" "Why don't you transfer all exclusive rights to the music?" >}}
Sometimes soundtracks become an additional means of project monetization and a source of superprofits. We consider it fair that in such cases, the composer is entitled to further compensation.

## Questions about consultations

{{< details "1" "Which kind of consultations do you have?" >}}
Currently, we offer two types of consultations: audio consultations for a specific project and audio reviews.

During an audio consultation, we discuss the project as a whole, notably its positioning; we highlight the main performing tasks of audio, help create a technical task, discuss possible ideas, talk about best practices and points of attention while working on audio.

The audio review includes game experience evaluation from an audio perspective, sound assessment of individual animations and/or cutscenes, and a document with suggestions for revisions.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "2" "What information must be prepared for the consultation?" >}}
We need to go through a detailed description of the project for both types of consultations in advance, including information about its target audience, market, and competitors. Also, any visual materials will come in handy: art, videos, animations, etc. And even if you have a pitch document, that's more than enough!

For the audio review, we also need a playable unlock build and a document with the names of all the audio assets and links to the corresponding animations.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "3" "How long does a consultation take?" >}}
An audio consultation for a specific project usually takes 1.5 hours, but we can extend it or run several sessions if necessary.

We perform audio reviews within three business days.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "4" "How do you provide the consultation?" >}}
We usually conduct an audio review in text format, and as a result, you will receive a text document.

We conduct audio consultations for a specific project in audio or video conferencing via Google Meet or Zoom.
{{< /details >}}

{{< details "5" "How much does the consultation cost?" >}}
An audio consultation for a specific project costs €100/hour.

The cost of an audio review is €400.

We also conduct three thirty-minute consultations or lite audio reviews every month for free. [Email us](mailto:{{% site_email %}}) to catch your slot.
