Nikattica is a Ukrainian YouTube channel where gaming blogger Veronika Rohova talks about‚Ä¶ video games, of course üôÇ Her videos are full of exciting content and exceptional aesthetics, making her channel stand out from the crowd. 

If you don‚Äôt believe video games are art, we recommend you {{%link_blank "follow the link" "https://www.youtube.com/@Nikattica"%}} and watch this incredibly talented creator. And for those who share this belief, there are like-minded people and many fascinating stories not only from video games but also from books and movies on Nikattica‚Äôs channel.

## Sound concept

When we started our work with Veronika, we immediately realized that Nikattica could not sound like other gaming channels. And it was more than just a matter of differentiation.

Most creators in this niche have masculine sound (which is logical because they are men). Moreover, they use super-energetic music from a limited range of genres associated with the gaming industry in the audience‚Äôs minds.

Nikattica‚Äôs content is different from most of her fellow creators, so it was clear that we had to find a new unique sound.

As always, we focused on a list of associations the audience should form while watching the video. We wanted to embody the idea that games are art (which is an essential idea of the channel), combine it with feelings of comfort and inspiration, and at the same time, pay tribute to the classics of games, animation, and cinema.

For that, we chose a mix of classical and lo-fi elements and instruments, added effects such as reverb and cozy pan effects, and made the cello the ‚Äúmain star‚Äù, which was later complemented by a kalimba.

The result is an elegant and modern audio brand that captivates the viewer and, at the same time, allows them to relax and have a good time.

## Challenge

Every project, even the most inspiring, always has challenges. This collaboration was no exception üôÇ 

Our initial idea was to create a few tiny audio assets for Nikattica, such as sound effects for an animated logo or a cutaway. But we got so involved in the process that we accidentally created a full-fledged audio brand.

However, it is even better because Veronika can easily scale her sound to meet new needs while maintaining integrity and thoughtfulness.

## Result

For the Nikattica YouTube channel, we created the following audio brand elements:

- audio DNA, which can be used for voiceless video parts if necessary
- audio logo;
- functional adaptations of the audio DNA for different videos, including a signature cutaway sound effect.
