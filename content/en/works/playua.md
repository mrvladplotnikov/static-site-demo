PlayUA is a Ukrainian entertainment internet media. They write about games, the film industry, comics, technologies, and pop culture trends. They publish reviews, analytical articles, author columns, interviews, and reports on the most exciting thematic events.

Exactly at one of these events, Vlad has met and given [a short interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmJ4SsnLzW4&list=PL4Jc69rq8qm9YofHKywTNcl4er6IjpfZj) to the guys from PlayUA. Later, behind the scenes, they discussed the YouTube channel of the media that lacked an audio identity. So everything turned into cooperation.

## Sound concept

Our work on the PlayUA audio brand (at that time, we haven’t planned it yet!) has started with a composing of a brand track. It was evident that we had to reflect this media’s activity and enhance the general brand image by using sound. Also, this track had to reach its target audience.

That’s why we have combined several music genres: rock, electronic, orchestral music, and Ukrainian ethnic music. We have imagined a fast tempo energetic track that emphasizes the target audience’s young age and the PlayUA team’s commitment.

By the way, the target audience’s musical preferences defined the track’s arrangement in electronic dance music style. Distorted electric guitars have added the necessary energy to the music.

Sounds of bandura and reed pipe underline that the brand is genuinely Ukrainian. The symphony orchestra elements pay tribute to the iconic orchestral soundtracks from the video games and film industry.

## Challenge

When we were creating the brand track, we had no idea that soon we would adapt its sound for the rest of the PlayUA’s touchpoints. So when we learned about the new task, we accepted this interesting challenge.

Of course, the brand track «Live, Create, Play» is not a classic audio DNA, but it became a great basis for our further work.

## Result

### In collaboration with PlayUA, we’ve created these audio identity elements:

- brand track «Live, Create, Play»;
- audio logo;
- retro versions of the brand track and audio logo for PlayUA’s 11th anniversary;
- podcast track;
- track for video reviews;
- brand track variations for «Play News» videos;
- signature Twitch notifications;
- signature mobile notifications.

### You can listen all of them below:
