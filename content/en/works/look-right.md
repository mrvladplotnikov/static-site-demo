If you like text quests, then you will love the Look Right. This interactive chat story will quickly immerse you in its world and give you the feeling of total presence.

What starts as an innocent virtual tour around the city of Odesa will turn out to be something much darker and will tickle your nerves. Your guide, a real girl, will get in trouble, and her salvation will depend on you. What will you do?

You can start your tour right [here](https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/look-right-escape-the-game/id1148161536).

## Sound concept

The Look Right sound was supposed to turn out atmospheric. And all this atmosphere can be divided into two categories: the light and relaxed atmosphere of Odesa and the atmosphere of suspense, detective investigation, and even fear.

In the first case, Vlad used the real sounds of Odesa streets: the buzzing crowd of tourists on Soborna Square, the cries of gulls, the noise of the trees of Primorsky Boulevard, and, of course, the sound of the sea. So the virtual tour sounds naturally like Odesa. 🙂

He experimented extensively with different synths and sound samples to create an oppressive atmosphere of horror and achieve the desired ambient sound.

## Challenge

The most crucial challenge was to make such sound in the app so that everything looked «as if shot with the phone’s camera.» Also, it was necessary to make the sound for many different media content and, each time, get into the style correctly.

Also, we had to make the background ambient saturated with emotions but, at the same time, not too intrusive. Its main task was to emotionally support everything that was happening and not to draw unnecessary attention to itself.

## Result
