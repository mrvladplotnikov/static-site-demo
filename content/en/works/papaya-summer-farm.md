Papaya: Summer Farm is a simulation game for Facebook, in which you will find yourself on a beautiful tropical island in the middle of the ocean.

The perfect sandy beach, clear turquoise waters, and incredible exotic birds and animals are already waiting for you. You can build your village, undertake the most exciting adventures and unravel all the island’s secrets.

You can play the game {{%link_blank "here" "https://papaya.quartsoft.com/uk/"%}}.

## Sound concept

The sound of Papaya is somewhat similar to the [BirdsIsle](works/birdsisle) case. By the way, thanks to that game, we started working with the QuartSoft team.

In this game, the visuals also dictated the style of music: tropical motifs and summer mood. Therefore, we selected the appropriate instruments: in the central theme, there are an acoustic guitar, marimba, various woodwinds, ethnic percussion, and glockenspiel.

In the track, we avoided the excessive «relaxed vibes» typical in the tropical style and made the composition fast enough and dynamic.

## Challenge

One of the requirements for the Papaya music was that it should become a point of differentiation from other farm games. Therefore, we needed to make it more functional than the game’s competitors’ music.

First, we analyzed the audio solutions of the leading market players and realized that their music was exclusively background-y. Based on this observation, we decided to add the aspect of emotional involvement to our composition.

The final track is still balancing on the verge of «background-ness» — it is needed so that the player does not become too tired of the composition too quickly. But we made the main accent on dynamics, a sense of adventure, and positive emotions.
