The Animal Garden: Zoo and Farm, as its name would suggest, is a game about building a fantastic zoo, taking care of animals, and giving great experiences to your visitors.

Apart from creating beautiful habitats for the animals from different biomes, you’ll also have to practiсe your farming skills in harvesting crops and producing goods. You’ll need the latter to rescue new animals and keep your visitors happy.

And yes, you can also design and decorate your zoo to make it truly unique!

You can play the game by following this {{<link_blank "link" "">}}.

## Sound concept

We’ve created the main theme that is also used as gameplay music and sound design that includes various sound effects and jingles for this project.

We wanted the music to be melodic and storytelling and lead players into the fun and adventure experience of building their own zoo. That’s why it sounds a bit cinematic but at the same time has fun and lively nuances. For example, a cowbell sound ties everything together with the farming part of the game.

We didn’t want this theme to be too background-y as it is a meaningful part of the game, but we also didn’t want to draw attention away from the gameplay. So that’s why it is very dynamic and thus not too repetitive, so it stays fresh and eventually kind of melts away during the long game sessions.

When it comes to the sound design, we aimed to create a comforting experience for players. Our priority was to give them a sensation of crafting and taking care of animals. Jingles were designed to grab players’ attention, inform and reward them for various actions. At the same time, it was essential to differentiate various game events using sound effects and jingles to ease the understanding of the gameplay.

Much effort has been made to sound design characters’ animations because the developers wanted them as lively as possible.

## Challenge

This project was big and long and had time intervals between tasks. So our main challenge was keeping up with the initial sound concept and controlling new audio asset packs to sound consistent with the previous ones.

It all went smoothly, though, as it wasn’t our first rodeo with the Turbo Rocket Games team, our longtime clients who supported us all the way. We’ve worked together for years and have built a solid partnership during the [WildCraft](works/wildcraft) project.
