[robota.ua](http://robota.ua/) is not just a job search site; it is a product company with unique features integrated into its products: searching for jobs on the map and selecting them with the help of artificial intelligence, employer verification, resume builder, etc.

Job search is a job in itself, so robota.ua does its best to make it easier by providing great solutions that save time and help people find cool jobs faster.

## Sound concept

We met the robota.ua team at the most opportune moment — they needed a push notification sound for their mobile app.

Of course, this task doesn’t sound complicated, but, as always, when it comes to audio branding, one short sound has a whole system behind it we had to create. After all, in a few seconds, the notification should not only grab the user’s attention but also evoke the correct associations that strengthen the overall brand.

So, after analyzing the image and communication of robota.ua, as well as the sound of the main competitors of this platform, we created a relevant audio concept.

To make robota.ua stand out in the market, we immediately abandoned the electronic sound with jelly synths, which became the most common cliché in the niche. Instead, we chose a creative vector that emphasized the friendliness of the service, care for users, and the soft tone of the overall brand communication.

In general, the sound of robota.ua’s audio DNA can be characterized as a mixture of electronics and happy indie vibes. The leitmotif gives a feeling of confident movement forward, but without haste, at a comfortable pace. At the same time, acoustic guitar, finger snaps, and choral vocal samples enhance the feeling of humanity and support.

Listen to how these elements work together below:

## Challenge

The main challenge of this project was creating a sound that would be understandable and resonate with the broadest possible audience. After all, robota.ua users seek diverse jobs, from office work to the service sector.

By the way, we had a similar challenge when creating [the sonic identity of monobank](/en/works/monobank)  (the most pleasing part is that the robota.ua team mentioned this case as one of the references!).

## Result

After testing different audio DNA options and choosing the most effective one, we created the signature robota.ua notification sound, which you can hear below:
