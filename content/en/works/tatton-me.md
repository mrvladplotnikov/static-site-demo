TATTon.me is a Ukrainian temporary tattoo brand that comes in thematic collections. Among the 60+ sets in different styles, everyone can find something that will complement an everyday outfit, express uniqueness, or add a memorable element to any event.

Moreover, TATTon.me has sets of AR tattoos for children. They Â«come to lifeÂ» if you watch them via a smartphone app. These are sets with images of animals from different countries and continents that move and sound funnily.

## Sound concept

When we started working on this project, we had no idea how it would end up. ðŸ™‚

Initially, we were working on the audio for the next AR map with the WeeSee team. In cooperation with them, we had previously created [the sound of the AR map of Ukraine](works/weesee).

We knew that we wanted to keep a similar style but improve some things this time.

For example, we made animalsâ€™ sound effects more realistic and informative while leaving some funny accents. The project was mainly aimed at the child audience, and we needed to make sure we fascinated them first and only then provided some new knowledge.

We created a mood board for the background track with the sensations it should evoke in users. The leading associations were Â«explorationÂ», Â«funÂ», Â«playfulness,Â» and Â«journeyÂ». For the basis, we took the same orchestral sound as in the previous project.

We also produced a voice-over for all AR elements in Ukrainian, English, and Russian.

And later, it turned out that the WeeSee animals moved to the TATTon.me application together with all the audio assets we had created! And thanks to the fact that they migrated all together, everything looks and sounds just like it should. ðŸ™‚

## Challenge

This project has become one of the most measured and calm in our practice. But this is not surprising because we continued to work on a product with a defined audio concept.

## Result

You can listen to the main melody of the TATTon.me app below. There, you will also find an alternative electronic version of the track, which we created as an experiment in case the brand decides to attract an older child audience.
