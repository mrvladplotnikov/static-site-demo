## About the project

«Become a star of your life — Get free medical treatment» is a photo art project of visual illusions that explains options for free breast cancer treatment in Ukraine. The project goal is to prove the availability of cancer treatment not only for the rich and famous but also for ordinary people with average and low incomes.

Chat-bot [«Лікуйся»](https://t.me/likuysia_bot) was created to reduce the cancer mortality rate and encourage cancer patients to seek treatment. It provides patients who have been diagnosed with breast cancer with the information they need for treatment under the Medical Guarantees Program in an easy-to-understand form. The chat-bot was used by more than 2600 people within two months after the launch, and it is the main focus of the art photo project.

The photo project was implemented by the public organization «Liky Control».

## Sound concept

When we first started talking to Natalia Guran, the project director, we immediately felt her pain about thousands of Ukrainian women refusing breast cancer treatment because of the lack of money. And it took us just a few minutes to understand the importance of the music for «Become a star of your life — Get free medical treatment» videos.  

The main task of the music is to attract viewers’ attention, change their emotional state, and give them a feeling of support and confidence. We also paid extra attention to not create negative associations and feelings like toxic pity with the music, because it is often used in manipulative communications about severe diseases like cancer.

Logically, all videos are divided into two parts. The first is about a mysterious star who is fighting or has beaten breast cancer. This part sounds very confident, trendy, and even a little glamourous. All in the best tradition of shows about the rich and famous. 🙂

Such music attracts attention and creates a perfect contrast to the second part, when the intrigue is revealed: the «star» is an ordinary woman who lives and works near you.

The sound of the video at the climax changes dramatically to a closer, more clear, and easy-to-understand one. However, we made it very melodic to emphasize the beauty and strongness of each heroine, as they are all stars of their lives.

We’d love this music to give the target audience the feeling of not being alone in their battle and the strength to overcome all the difficulties.
