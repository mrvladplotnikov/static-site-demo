Coral Isle 2: Tropical Stories is a game by QuartSoft, with whom we previously collaborated on the [Papaya: Summer Farm](papaya-summer-farm).

Coral Isle 2 is a Facebook farming game about travelers who survive a plane crash and find themselves on a tropical island somewhere in the ocean. Players have to help the main characters conquer this mysterious land and build their dream farm. Fabulous adventures, exotic animals, and ancient secrets come as a bonus!

The most exciting part is that the sequel of the Coral Isle game was co-created with its community, as the developers used playersâ€™ ideas and put them into the game.

## Sound concept

Weâ€™ve composed the main theme for this project, which also doubles as a gameplay one.

When the developersâ€™ team contacted us, they underlined that the original game had a nice and working soundtrack, much loved by the audience. So the idea was to use that track as a base for the one we had to compose.

Weâ€™ve studied the Coral Isle music and found the musical idea we wanted to extend and modernize so that the sequel got all the original gameâ€™s best features but evolved in quality.

During the game, players have to transform this wild and unknown island into a prosperous farm/town. That is why we wanted to create these senses of fun, tropics, and adventures while having sound remain modern and Â«civilizedÂ».

For this purpose, we chose instruments such as marimba, various wood percussions (darbuka, djembe, African rice shaker, adewuro, gome, udu drum), bass guitar, various flutes (bamboo flute, panflute, tenor flute), glockenspiel, piano, and acoustic guitar samples. Weâ€™ve also added vocals and a choir to make the music even more lively. 

Considering that the music plays all the time during the game session, weâ€™ve made it dynamic so that the loop wonâ€™t sound way too repetitive.

## Challenge

Before this project, weâ€™ve never composed music based on someone elseâ€™s track. We always tend to create our own audio concepts for games with whom we collaborate, so the main challenge was to follow outlined guidelines and keep the concept of the Coral Isle 2.

However, in the end, it all went smoothly, as we know how audio DNA works and how it should be treated. ðŸ™‚
