## About the product

HYP podcasts is a project of Hellenic Youth Participation, an organization based in Athens, Greece, that stands for intercultural dialogue, non-formal education, mutual understanding, and solidarity. The Hellenic Youth Participation receives from and sends volunteers around the globe within the European Solidarity Corps program and is supported by the Greek National Agency.

The Hellenic Youth Participation aims to promote human rights through non-formal education and experiential learning. The organization trains different age groups (teenagers, young adults, parents, and teachers) to inspire and stimulate European citizens to become active parts of their local and European communities. The HYP motivates people to become involved and raise awareness about current values like equal opportunities, social inclusion, and cultural diversity. Through its projects, HYP promotes non-formal differentiated learning and the importance of personal development. The HYP works at the local, national and European levels.

That’s why the HYP podcasts were created. It is a source for young people to receive information about the European Solidarity Corps, Erasmus+ Programme, Youth Exchanges, examples of volunteering experiences, and traveling abroad. These podcasts also aim to build a community that shares the same values and is open to intercultural mobilities.

## Sound concept

When we started working on the audio of the HYP podcast, first of all, we decided to mix several music styles to make a reflection on the intercultural aspect of the Hellenic Youth Participation. That’s why we added different musical elements like crunchy rock guitars, hip-hop beats, electronic bass lines, various synths, and different ethnic instruments.

Then we aimed to underline the idea of community and human touch, an essential part of the Hellenic Youth Participation. So we added lots of «human» percussion, such as claps and finger snaps. That’s also the reason behind the usage of vocal chops. 

We also wanted to bond the audio to the fact that HYP is an organization based in Greece. Hence, we used a modernized harp. 

A dance rhythmic pattern and medium+ tempo reflect the ideas of activism and passion. Warm-sounding electronic pads and simple, clear melody stand for openness and safety.

Overall, we achieved a modern sound that will give a younger audience the welcoming vibe of the community with a solid place for each of them.

## Challenge

The creative process was very relaxing and pleasant on this project. However, we had to skip the testing stage and rely solely on the audio concept because of slightly tight deadlines. That’s always a risk, but in the end, everything worked out!

## Result

For the HYP podcasts, we created an audio set containing intro and outro tracks and a break to be used between the podcast sections.
