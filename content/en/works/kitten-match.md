Weâ€™ve worked on this short opening video for casual game Kitten Match together with the Kyiv art department of international gaming company Skymoons Interactive.

In the animated video, a lonely kitten walking in the middle of snowy winter finds a warm home and family. Moreover, this moment of joyful reunion means the start of a fantastic journey for the player.

## Sound concept

We immediately realized that music and sounds should not only convey the right atmosphere but also emotionally enhance this video.

We chose the leading associations that we wanted to emphasize, and then built the entire audio concept around the ideas of family and acceptance, not also forgetting about the warmth and coziness.

Thatâ€™s why the melody starts with the piano solo part, with other instruments added gradually, and then it merges into an orchestral sound full of strings, wind, and drums right in the culmination. Also, the moment when a kitten finds a new owner, the tempo of composition changes, and this symbolize a new beginning in a Â«fluffyÂ» life. ðŸ™‚

In terms of sound, we intentionally made it close and Â«dryÂ», just like in old cartoons like Tom and Jerry. It helped to create the right sense of coziness and warmth.

We created a sound design with an emphasis on realism and maintaining the overall atmosphere.

## Challenge

The project went quite smoothly, so we canâ€™t say that there was any real challenge for us in it.

We had quite tight deadlines. Also, we were creating audio in parallel with the video production process, and because of that, sometimes, we had to anticipate some nuances in advance.

However, we were so happy to finally get back to work on the animation that we didnâ€™t even find it all to be any difficulties.

## Result
