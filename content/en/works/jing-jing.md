Have you got exhausted from the bustle? Then you urgently need to play Jing! Jing! and relax—colorful timekiller in endless game mode with simple and straightforward rules.

Tap the screen, hold the ball on the field, break the “bricks” and bonus elements, get stars, and compete with friends. New records are waiting for you to set them!

## Sound concept

The soundtrack for the game Jing! Jing! is balancing the fine line between background and emotionally engaging music. On the one hand, it should support the player during the process and add notes of fun and enthusiasm. Still, on the other, it should not cross the line and become too annoying because the game can last forever.

Vlad chose an acoustic guitar, tambourine, and various synths for a relaxing and cheerful-sounding composition. The main inspiration for creating music was the soundtrack to the game Two Dots.

In Jing! Jing! you can play on three different maps, and each has its elements. Therefore, Vlad has developed three different sound design concepts for the project. And for them to sound good within one game, each sound was initially combined with the main musical theme.

Many sounds for the game were created using foley recordings.

## Challenge

If everything went relatively smoothly with the soundtrack, it was necessary to work hard to create the right sound design. The fact is that in a game, many actions can take place simultaneously, and each of them sounds different. It was crucial to avoid a possible “mess” of sounds.

To do this, Vlad made each effect neat, accented, and short while ensuring that all sounded harmoniously overlapped and did not interfere with background music.
