The Indie Cup is the largest contest of indie developers in Eastern Europe. Thanks to it, every year, more than two hundred teams can find publishers and partners or just get a «ticket to the big world».

For five years, more than 900 games from Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus participated in the Cup, and 59 teams won in various categories. In this competition, the winners get prizes from industrial companies and tickets to professional conferences, and the nominees get feedback from industry experts and media. But the most important thing is that each participant of the Indie Cup has a chance to show their project to publishers and attract the attention of players.

You can learn more about the contest [on its official website](https://indiecup.net/).

## Sound concept

This year, the Indie Cup team decided to strengthen their media presence, so the Cup needed its own sound that would unite all its audiovisual channels of communication with the audience.

We talked to the organizers, studied the Cup’s communication, and found the central idea that we supposed to embody in the audio brand: «Indie Cup is a catalyst under the influence of which developers, publishers, experts, and services come together and form a structure that opens up new ideas and projects to the world».

We started developing an audio brand with a brand track, which in this case, can also be considered an audio DNA. We conveyed the central message first of all melodically, not forgetting to add a sense of competition and excitement as we are still talking about the contest. The choice of musical instruments also played an essential role in forming the necessary sound, where each texture symbolizes one of the main elements of the Indie Cup brand.

## Challenge

This time the main challenge for us was the fact that we have been part of this competition for a few years already as we choose the winner in the Best Audio category. That’s why it took us some time to take the position of an observer and to look at the brand unbiased.

The Indie Cup is, first of all, a diversity of people, where everyone has their own position, their own task, and their personal significance. Organizers, developers, partners, and sponsors, all of them influence the brand in one way or another, and we had to show this in its sound in the right way.

We made sure that our involvement as partners and good relations with the organizers did not affect our vision and the final result, and everything seems to have worked out. 🙂

## Result

For the Indie Cup audio brand, we have developed the following elements:

- audio logo;
- brand track;
- brand track variations.
